 # Days of the Week Enum in Java

## Description
In week four I created a java project that demonstrates the use of an `enum` to represent the days of the week. 
The project contains a superclass (`Week`) that lists all the days and a subclass (`Weekend`) that inherits from `Week` and filters out the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). 
This example showcases basic Java concepts such as inheritance, `enum`, and object-oriented programming.

## Features
- Enum `DaysOfWeek` capturing all days of the week.
- Superclass `Week` that prints all days of the week.
- Subclass `Weekend` that prints only the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
